# <u> Clothing Retail Store DBMS </u>
This project is a Database Management System designed for a hypothetical bridal store, as part of a Database Systems course. The system integrates SQL, Java, and Shell Scripting to offer robust functionalities such as inventory and client management, order processing, and reporting. It also features both terminal-based and graphical user interfaces for ease of operation.

## Core Functionalities

- Inventory Management: Tracks veils and gowns with attributes like stock quantity, restocking date, and material details.
- Customer Management: Maintains customer profiles, measurements, and transaction history.
- Order Processing:
  - Buy Orders: Handles purchases with itemized details, taxes, and order status.
  - Rental Orders: Manages rental transactions, return dates, and rental-specific attributes.
- Alterations: Tracks customization details, costs, and deadlines for ordered items.
- Payment Management: Processes payments linked to orders with attributes like payment type, amount, and status.
- Data Integrity: Enforces relationships and functional dependencies between entities for consistency.

## Features

- Database Integration: Oracle database integration using JDBC.
- Custom Data Types: Utilizes Oracle object types for structured data storage.
- Table Management:
Create, drop, and populate tables with predefined structures and sample data.
- Query Execution:
Predefined and custom SQL queries to fetch client orders, inventory details, and sales data.
- Reporting:
Generate detailed reports such as revenue by client, top-selling items, pending payments, and more.
- Java Integration:
JDBC-based application for connecting to Oracle databases and executing operations.
- Graphical User Interface:
User-friendly Swing-based interface for intuitive interaction with the database.
